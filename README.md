This is a simple anagram game designed using flask to handle the backend logic and AJAX to 
update the front end without page redirects. Main logic can be found in flask_vocab.py and 
front end designed in vocab.html. Created for CIS 322 at the University of Oregon.

Usage: Copy credentials_skel.ini and rename copy as credentials.ini with preferred defaults.
Build Docker image and run.
